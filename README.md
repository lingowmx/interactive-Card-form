## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

First of all. Read the instructions and what the client is asking. 
Some regex for email validation and separation of characters in the card 
Realize that is better to work with more divisions, that makes it easy to give better and more specified styles to mobile and desktop designs
